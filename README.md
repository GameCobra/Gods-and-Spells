An addon to Unciv designed to add magic to it

I only recomend playing the first few Nightmare difficultys if you are very good and have beaten deity and want an extra challenge, the latter Nightmare difficultys are practicly impossable without other mods. The latter ones could be interesting if you have some really powerful custom civ though.

Nightmare+ is designed to be impossable even with some really OP mods. It is not designed to be remotly possable or at all balanced, so try at your own risk to your sanity :).
